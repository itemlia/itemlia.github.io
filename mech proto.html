        <p>this is my first ever unreal game i made for a university assignment. this game was all about level design and development as well as serving as an introduction to blueprints. notes: all assets belong to staffordshire university</p>

        <p>this was my first ever unreal engine project that i had to make as part of a university assignemnt focused on game mechanics. i am not 100% happy with how it turned out but i do think it's good for what it is. i had never used unreal at all before, prefering to use unity so i had to learn the basics of the engine whilst completing the assignment. i struggled a fair bit at the start as i got frustrated when i knew how to code something but i couldn't do it in blueprints. i do think with more time and a better understanding i could've made a better game.</p>
