        <p>this is my second blender project. this project was made without any tutorials, just using image references to help make the models. note: none of the textures belong to me.</p>

        <p>i was really happy with how this project turned out. it was my second ever time using blender so i was still not super comfortable with the software but the more i worked on it the better i felt i got. i decided to do something simple like a dinner set as i wasn't overly confident i could do anything more complex yet. it's definately not perfect but for a second attempt i'm happy with how it turned out.</p>
