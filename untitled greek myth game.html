      <div class="normal">
        <p>i've always had a massive interest in greek mythology; i own tons of non-fiction books about the greek myths as well as having read every single book in the percy jackson universe. i thought it would be fun to make a game inspired by all those greek myths, like hades is. at the moment i'm in the very early stages of prototyping base mechanics like movement and godly parent generation, but my dream is to have a game kind of like a jrpg where you have to go and carry out quests for the gods and live out your life as a demigod in greece! there's a short demo of gameplay mechanics below if you click on the image to view the youtube video.</p>
