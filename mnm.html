        <p>this is a short game i made as part of a university assignment. this game focuses on basic level design and developing gameplay mechanics. notes: all assets used are not owned by me</p>

        <p>this is my favourite out of all of the games i made during 1st year. this game was inspired heavily by stardew valley but i added a few of my own things to it. it's really short and unfinished, only taking about 5 minutes to play through but i was really happy with how it turned out and if i ever get the chance i might make it into a fully fledged game.</p>
