        <p>this prototype i had 3 weeks to develop, this including the planning as well as the programming. the brief we were given for this prototype was '1 stick 1 button = multiple mechanics' and out of this i made a rough climbing game. the game is very basic due to the time constraint that i had but it was my first go at making a game non rpg based which i had fun with.</p>
